Upgrading from v0.3.x and lower to v0.4.0
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This document describes the steps you need to do when upgrading XJConf from any
of the 0.3.x versions and lower to 0.4.0.

1. Remove all includes of XJConf classes by hand. Instead, just include
   XJConf/XJConf.php at the beginning of your application or script. This will
   register an autoload method that takes care of loading all other classes
   from XJConf.

2. Replace every occurance of XJConfLoader::load('package.ClassName'); with
   use net::xjconf::package::ClassName;.
   For example, if you use the XJConfFacade, you need to replace
   XJConfLoader::load('XJConfFacade');
   with
   use net::xjconf::XJConfFacade;
   while using
   XJConfLoader::load('DefinitionParser', 'XmlParser');
   needs to be replaced with
   use net::xjconf::DefinitionParser;
   use net::xjconf::XmlParser;
